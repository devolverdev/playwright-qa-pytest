    # 🧪 Playwright + Pytest Automation Project

This project is part of my hands-on learning journey with **Playwright**, **Pytest**, and **Page Object Model (POM)** in Python. It reflects structured, real-world QA practices including test automation, accessibility testing, file management, and development tools.

Created and maintained by **Bruna Vignola de Marco**, QA Engineer & Python learner.

## ✅ What This Project Covers

- ✔️ Web form automation using Playwright
- ✔️ Modular code using the Page Object Model (POM)
- ✔️ HTML test reports via `pytest-html`
- ✔️ Secure credential storage using config separation
- ✔️ Clean code with `black` formatter
- ✔️ Linting with `flake8` for PEP8 compliance
- ✔️ Screenshot capture for test results
- ✔️ Organized repo using `config`, `pages`, and `tests`

## 🔒 Credential Security

Credentials are stored inside `config/secrets.py` as variables and imported into test files.  
This is an example placeholder:

```python
USERNAME = "Bruna Test"
PASSWORD = "secure123"

## 🚀 How to Run

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
